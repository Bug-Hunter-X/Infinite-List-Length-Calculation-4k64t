This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming: attempting to compute the length of an infinite list. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from the fact that Haskell's `length` function needs to traverse the entire list to determine its length. This is impossible for infinite lists, leading to non-termination.
